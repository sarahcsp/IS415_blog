## Boxplot

Before learning about Choropleth map and how to code it, we started off with the Boxplot. 

- Boxplot is one one the popular Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) technique used to show the statistics and distribution of data values.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
ggplot(data=mpszpop2020, 
       aes(x = "", 
           y = AGED)) +
  geom_boxplot()
